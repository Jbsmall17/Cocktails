# Cocktails
This React application is a replica of John Smilga's React Cocktails project. It serves as a 
platform where users can explore their favorite cocktails and access essential details about the chosen drinks. 
The website showcases a collection of cocktails retrieved from an API. 
Each API request fetches 25 or below cocktails, which are then presented in groups of five using pagination.
The state management is efficiently handled through the Context API. To initiate the project, follow these steps:
1. Install dependencies with the command: npm install
2. Run the project using: npm run dev
